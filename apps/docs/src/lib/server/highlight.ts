/**
 * Colouring code, on the server and once.

 * Shiki is a real TextMate grammar engine and is worth about a megabyte. Loading
 * it in the browser would put that in front of every reader for the sake of
 * something that never changes after a deploy — so it runs where the page is
 * rendered, and what reaches the browser is the markup it produced.
 *
 * The highlighter is a module-level promise rather than a per-request one:
 * building it takes a couple of hundred milliseconds and the answer is the same
 * every time.
