	<p>
		The types and one method per operation — {data.counts.operations} of them and
		{data.counts.models} shapes, in every language. They come out of
		<code>openapi.json</code>, which the api writes from annotations that sit on its own handlers,
		and a test there drives every path in that document against the real router.
	</p>

	<p>
		So none of the six can be behind the others, and none of them can describe an endpoint that
		does not exist. There is <strong>one reader</strong> shared by all six emitters, because six
		emitters each reading the document would be six places that have to agree about what
		<code>allOf</code> means — and they would not: the first language written would be right and the
		sixth would have a subtly different idea of which fields are optional.

	<p>This is the half that decides whether a client is pleasant rather than merely correct.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>The four OAuth flows.</strong> Authorization code with PKCE, the refresh that
			rotates, <code>client_credentials</code>, and the device flow.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>A token that renews itself</strong>, with the refresh serialised through one lock.
			Four requests noticing one expiry must send one refresh between them: the tokens rotate, so
			the second would present one the first has retired — and the server can only read that as
			theft.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Backing off on the numbers the server actually sent</strong>, rather than guessing.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Paginators</strong> that stop on a short page rather than on <code>total</code>.</li>
		<li><strong>One error type per phrase name.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Verifying a webhook</strong>, over the raw bytes, in constant time, with the age checked.</li>
	</ul>

	</h2>

	<p>
		Four of the six leave the field names exactly as they arrive, because
		<code>shikimori_id</code> is already their own convention. Kotlin and C# rename them —
		<code>shikimoriId</code>, <code>ShikimoriId</code> — and in those two the mapping is written on
		every single field rather than only where the two disagree: the day a field arrives already
		camelCase it would silently have no annotation, and nobody would notice until it did disagree.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <a href="/reference">reference</a> shows both, and switches with the language tab.

	<p>
		Every library exposes its transport, so a route that exists and has not been generated yet is
		still reachable — and an issue at
		<a href="https://github.com/cykacloud/acyka-sdk">cykacloud/acyka-sdk</a> is the way to say so.
